## Industry Associations

### Neutral Internet eXchange of the Czech Republic (NIX.CZ) 

The Neutral Internet eXchange of the Czech Republic (NIX.CZ) associates Internet service providers in the Czech Republic with the objective of interconnecting their networks. The memorandum of association was signed on August 30, 1996. The association was registered by the District Council for Prague 6 on October 1, 1996 under company registration number 65990471. Its statutory body is a three-member Board of directors. Under its articles of association, the highest body of the association is the general meeting.[1] The association is an active member of Euro-IX.

The association has constructed an internet exchange point in Prague, the Czech Republic, which interconnects the Internet networks of the individual providers, both association members and external customers, and allows IPv4 and IPv6 peering currently in five independent locations, Points of Presence.

### CSIRT.CZ 

CSIRT.CZ is a national CSIRT (Cyber Security Response Team) team operated by CZ.NIC (operator of the .CZ top-level domain). CSIRT.CZ's main task is to handle security incidents in computer networks operated in the Czech Republic. Source https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRT.CZ

### CZ.NIC

CZ.NIC is a Czech interest association of legal persons established by leading Internet service providers in 1998. The main activity of the association is administration of domain names .cz and 0.2.4.e164.arpa (ENUM), administration of .cz top-level domains and education in the area of domain names. Currently, the employees of the association are intensively working on expanding the DNSSEC technology[citation needed], developing the domain administration system and mojeID service and promoting new technologies and projects beneficial to the Internet infrastructure in the Czech Republic.

## Internet Exchange Points

### NIX.CZ

NIX.CZ is the largest Neutral Internet Exchange Point (IXP) in the Czech Republic. Consistent and meticulous planning, sophisticated technical solutions and a 24/7/365 technical support have led to a failure-free operation of the node.

Capacity: 19.4 Tbps
Maximum: 3.2 Tbps
Networks: 216
On RS: 95%



#### Services

##### Internet peering

Internet Peering is the essential service offered by Internet exchanges. Networks connected to the NIX.CZ platform have the opportunity to interconnect with other connected networks; usually ISPs, content providers, Internet media, search engines and many others. This makes interconnection between networks easier and also more cost efficient.

To carry out faster and easier interconnections, NIX.CZ operates Route Servers for public peering. This service allows networks to connect to the Route Servers where they can mutually interconnect without further configuration.

Service enables data exchange by the employment of IPv4 and IPv6 protocols and is available in the following capacities 1GE, 10GE, 25GE, 40GE, 100GE a 400GE.


##### Private links (VLAN)

Private Interconnect (PI or PNI) enables direct traffic exchange between two networks over a dedicated VLAN on the NIX.CZ infrastructure. Members or Customers are only connected together by express mutual agreement and are only charged for the initial setup of the VLAN, with no additional install/setup fees or any recurring charges after installation of up to five VLANs.


##### TLD Hosting

This service provided by our exchange is primarily designed for Top Level Domain and Root Server operators to improve the quality and availability of their DNS infrastructure. The conditions and procedures vary according to the individual needs of each customer.



#### Network Topology 

Our new NIX.CZ leaf-spine infrastructure topology, built on Virtual Extensible LAN (VxLAN) and Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN), brings a revolutionary improvement to the stability and development of our peering platform. This combination of modern technologies enables efficient connection and management of data flows in our network.

By using VxLAN, we have achieved greater flexibility and scalability in our network. This technology enables the creation of virtualized network segments, which gives us the ability to dynamically connect sites and optimize data flows. Thanks to EVPN, we are able to efficiently manage routing and transfer information about network paths between devices.

The new topology enabled a transition from the original virtualized star to a leaf-spine model, creating redundancy and increasing overall network reliability. In this way, we could easily integrate other locations, including Bratislava, Vienna and Frankfurt, and optimize the data flow between them.

In 2020, in response to the growing demand for high-speed connections, we started deploying Cisco Nexus 9300 access switches. These switches allow us to provide 100GE and even 400GE connections, which meets the ever-increasing data transfer demands of our network. In this way, we were able to effectively manage the continued increase in the volume of transferred data and provide our customers with top-notch and scalable access to our peering platform.

## Mapping Backhaul

Useful: https://vportal.ctu.gov.cz/intro


For broadband mapping, an infrastructure mapping website (https://www.ctu.cz/nga-sber-dat)  has been established by the Czech Telecommunication Office (CTU) (https://www.ctu.eu/). Mapping is provided at the level of so-called "basic settlement units". For these units, the evaluation is made whether the location is suitable for public subsidy. In terms of coverage mapping, three bandwidth groups are differentiated: up to 30 Mbps, 30-100 Mbps, 100 Mbps and more. The existing and planned networks (forecast for 3 years) are to be included in the database.

The Visualization Portal of telecommunication services (VPortal) (https://vportal.ctu.gov.cz/) offers a comprehensive visualisation tool that helps users compare the quality of telecommunications services. The portal is divided into individual modules according to the type of services. It contains data obtained from measurements carried out by CTU and other types of data, e.g. coverage calculations, base stations in trial, transmitters.

# Community-related

PilsFree here - We aren't a company, we are a community organization. Our membership "fee" is 300czk, and our membership benefits are Internet (1000/1000 Mbps on optic in specific areas of Pilsen (Bolevec, Lochotín), lower on wireless, but we have 50/50 as the floor. We are only limited by technology, we don't limit anyone's speed. If there is a problem, you can contact your "správce" and ask them about the speed. You can buy your own antenna pair and we will happily make you a private connection. Other membership benefits include IPTV (around 50 channels with more purchasable from a 3rd party company), serverhosting and some meetups and free theater. I live a few kms north form Pilsen and I get 700/700 (in the middle of the night, in the evening it comes down to around 350/500 due to heavy traffic). Ask me anything.
