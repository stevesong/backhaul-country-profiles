# Country Resources for Choosing Internet Backhaul #

This repository is a resource for community-centred connectivity providers to source information regarding internet backhaul in selected countries.  It is intended to cover backbone providers including fibre, wireless, and satellite operators as well as information regarding IXPs, datacentres, CDNs, and related resources.  Backhaul equipment suppliers, manufacturers, and construction companies are also intended to be captured here.

This is a rapidly changing work in progress.  Currently only [South Africa](South-Africa) has any content.  Please feel free to fork the repository and begin your own country profile or contribute to another.  Feel free to post questions on the [Issues](https://github.com/stevesong/backhaul-country-profiles/issues) page.
